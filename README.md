# 💕 For Gayathri — Valentine Proposal

A Valentine’s Day proposal website for **Manikandan** to ask **Gayathri** to be his Valentine. Built with React and Framer Motion.

## Features

- **Intro screen** — “For Gayathri with a gentle entrance animation  
- **Proposal screen** — Gayathri, will you be my Valentine?” with **Yes** and **No** buttons  
- **No button** — Moves away when hovered (playful “can’t say no” moment)  
- **Yes = celebration** — Full-window burst of hearts and confetti, then “She said YES!”, “Proposal Accepted”, and a short message from Manikandan  
- **Animations** — Floating hearts in the background, Framer Motion transitions, and a full-screen celebration when she says yes
